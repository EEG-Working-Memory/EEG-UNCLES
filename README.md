# EEG-UNCLES
Github for my EUSIPCO 2019 paper: "Identify-Spatial-Similarity-of-Electroencephalography-EEG-During-Working-Memory-Maintenance".

This is my original code. Most of them are just for prepossing data or painting final picture.  
The main code is write based on a [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/UNCLES/index.html). There is a 2.0 version impelemented by python [clust](https://github.com/BaselAbujamous/clust)

Because of some future work, I have not open the EEG dataset and intermediate result.
